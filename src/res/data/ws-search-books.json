The AAF attack the Moon and Mars colonies, but are repulsed by ECDS forces. On Earth, with the AAF seemingly defeated, humans and androids unite to create the city of Utopia. Threats from a reformed, more powerful AAF emerges and the crew of the ECDS flagship Harmonia must formulate a defence. The mysterious Evolved Androids appear on Earth with a sytoid child called Eirini, who has strange powers.
